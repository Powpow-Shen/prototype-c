# prototype-c 
### Sailsjs + Polymer + assetgraph

For easier development, assetgraph only works in production mode not in development mode.
To take full advantage of the image processing and optimization features, you can checkout [assetgraph-builder] page.

> TODO: Due to assetgraph can only work on static html, so I put an index.html in assets temporarily. There could be a better way to do this.

Note:
* Just "cp -rf prototype-c/* dest/ && cp prototype-c/.gitignore dest/ && cp prototype-c/.bowerrc dest/".
* npm i
* node app.js
